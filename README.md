# DEZE

> *Gateway to the Future*

Welcome to **DEZE** — my personal corner of the internet.

This is my landing page, a central hub where all my projects live under one roof. Every project I build gets its own space under the `deze.me` domain, and this page brings them all together automatically — no manual updates needed every time something new is added.

## 🤖 AI as a Tool, Not the Author

I use **AI to speed up my development workflow** — but let me be clear: I'm still the one in charge.

Every project here is driven by my own ideas, decisions, and architecture. AI is simply a tool I use to move faster — like how a developer uses a library or a shortcut. It doesn't design the project, it doesn't make the calls, and it doesn't decide what gets built.

- **I define the vision** — what to build and why
- **I own the architecture** — how everything is structured and connected
- **I review every line** — nothing ships without me understanding it
- **AI handles the repetitive parts** — so I can focus on what actually matters

Think of it less like "AI built this" and more like "I built this, faster."
